## Fuel Tanks

### Rear fuel tank cutoff

The fuel hose size on these bikes is of an odd size, about 7.5 mm. The quick disconnect and fuel back flow connectors are of slightly different diameters.

The good news is that a 5/16 inch (equivalent to 8mm) will work with the fuel line. A Motion Pro 5/16 inch fuel shut off you can find on Amazon for about $20.

Removed a few inches of hose from the bottom quick disconnect to make the spacer hose on the valve and then some to get some of the hump out of the fuel line path to the bottom tank.

It might be a good idea to also install a one way check valve to prevent fuel from the main tanks from migrating to the rear.

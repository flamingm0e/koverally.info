#### Fuel cap pressure relief

The stock fuel caps have a design flaw. When the pressure builds up, it pushes the rubber, and it can cause the holes in the rubber to collapse.

The fix is to vent the caps better.

Take the front caps (rear cap doesn't vent out top) off and either cut more holes, or just remove the end of the rubber off.

They have now fixed this in the later models. There is now a hole in the center of the rubber as standard.

## Known Issues

---

- Too much pressure is building up in the fuel tanks
  - Doing the [fuel cap modification](/450R/mods/fuel_caps.md) should alleviate this.
- Posts in airbox air filter frame can break free from the plate causing them to spin freely.
  - JB Weld applied at the base of the post where it meets the plate should fix this.
- Coolant Overflow reservoir cap
- Wheel/Tire Balance
  - Front tire comes horribly unbalanced
- Inaccurate fuel gauge
  - The consensus so far has been that doing the [cannister delete](/450R/mods/cannister_delete.md) and [venting the fuel caps](/450R/mods/fuel_caps.md) mostly resolve the issue.
- Non-Pro model front turn signals interfere with removing the front fairing quickly.
  - Remove and install waterproof connectors
- Oil cooler upper right banjo leaking
  - Check that it is tight when assembling the bike
- There is no sight glass to check oil level
  - [How to check your oil level](/450R/mods/engine.md#oil)
- Neck bearings failing after less than 2500km
  - Numerous people giving feedback that neck bearings have failed. If you are planning on doing long trips / racing you should replace them with Japanese bearings.
